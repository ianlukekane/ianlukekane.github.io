Those of you who have ever ready anything by Kurt Vonnegut know that his
style is full of the type of sarcasm that reads as apparent fact. The
following excerpt from his book Cat's Cradle is no exception when it
comes to what the author is actually saying about technology. This
fiction traces the effects of pure knowledge manifested through
technology, as well as the role of religion and belief in a world of
tech. Cat's Cradle is a quick read, and is well worth the time. The book
maint ains of level of uncomfortable humor throughout, which made me ask
myself more than once why I was laughing.

I've read two books recently that have traced the same type of theme,
though from different angles. The first is the aforementioned Cat's
Cradle. The second is the late Neil Postman's Technopoly. This is my
first reading of anything by Postman, though he has been on my "to read"
list for several years now. His legacy is one of cultural criticism,
especially concerning the subjects of education, entertainment, and
technology.

The book Technopoly expounds upon the current trend of wholesale faith
in all things technical. In other words, in our common belief that
anything created through an application of pure science will lead to a
better life both in the here and now and in the future. This belief
holds in medicine, education, entertainment, food consumption, as well
as other areas.

As an example, Postman recounts an experiment he would perform on fellow
colleagues. He would walk up to a fairly education person and say
something like "Did you hear that there was an article in the New York
Times today about a Harvard scientific study which found that
individuals who drank coffee every morning are 35% smarter than those
who don't?" He found, more often than not, that though the subject of
this study would have initial reservations about the study, the common
response was something like "Wow, that's strange", or "Where did you say
that study was from again?". In other words, the common response was one
of belief rather than unbelief.

The modern mindset states still that science is king. If it can be
wrought by science, not only is it true, but it is most likely good as
well. His term Technopoly applies to cultures who express an unreserved
belief in the process of technological innovation. We eat it up without
fail, oftentimes without a thought to the consequences. In this thread
Postman traces some of what has been lost in education due to this
reliance. One is the lack of focus in using memory. Since all
information is immediately available it has become even more unnecessary
to use memory as a discipline (in contrast to the era of print, in which
reliance on memory was greatly reduced, but not totally eliminated).
Also, since our culture has generally adopted the mindset that "what is
newer is better", education has shifted its focus away from the "classic
founts" of education, such as logic, grammar, early philosophy, and the
like.

I don't totally agree with Postman's conclusions. He seems to a certain
extent to pine for a bygone age. But I do think his voice sounds a
necessary warning. At the very least we should as a culture stand back
and think of the consequences of our faith in science expressed through
technology. Of course, I say this as a technological "early adopter". I
very often love looking into the latest and greatest in regard to
technology, especially when it comes to personal computing and
"gadgets". I need to do a better job of critically engaging our culture
on this front.

I do think that our culture has responded to some areas of technology in
a critical way. Looking at the organic food movement of the past several
years I would have to conclude that there has been at the very least a
noticeable minority of people who have become interested in eating food
the "natural" way. Sales of organic products in places like Whole Foods,
local farms, co-ops, and markets has been stunning to me. People are
interested in hormone-free milk, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef, and
pesticide-free produce. As far as the food market is concerned, the
consumer doesn't seem to be doing a terrible job letting business know
what it wants. I can only hope that this particular trend will expand.

Consider this as an introduction to a topic that I'd like to continue
writing about. Just because it's new doesn't mean it's better. And just
because we _can_ do it doesn't mean that we _ought_ to do it, either
because it is ethically questionable from a philosophical perspective,
or because the consumer isn't calling for it from an economic
perspective.
