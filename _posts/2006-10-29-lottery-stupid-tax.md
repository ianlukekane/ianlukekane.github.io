I don't know what the hell
[this](http://web.archive.org/web/20090317073809/http://www.news.com.au:80/story/0,23599,20642299-13762,00.html)
article seems to be talking about. I _think_ that the article would like
me to believe that several professors at a school in the UK have somehow
"cracked" the lottery system. Well, let's examine their method. They
"bagged the big prize by using two boxes, 49 pieces of paper and a large
amount of brain power". Check. It took the group 4 years and about
$9000, but they actually hit the six digit number to the tune of $13
million.

Ahem...

Luck. These people **_hit_** the lottery. These people didn't "crack"
anything. This so-called system of "brain power": luck. Though I don't
know all of the particulars regarding the lottery game they won, I can
be sure that their method didn't vastly improve their odds. (If anyone
knows exactly how the odds were changed using the method described in
the article please let me know.)

It's PROBABILITY, people! The state wouldn't **_run_** a lottery if
they didn't make money off of it. The lottery is **_designed_** to make
the state money. And I assure you that they make a LOT of money off of
us playing.

So please, don't let articles like this fool you. There is no system
for winning the lottery. At least not one that's profitable. Or legal.
So go invest your money in a house or a mutual fund. Consider this my
public service announcement of the day.
