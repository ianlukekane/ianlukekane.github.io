I've come across a few sites that list facetious facts about Gauss,
similar to the wonderful
[Chuck Norris Facts](http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com/) that we've all
come to love. Gauss, if you don't know it, was one of those
hyper-intelligent individuals who may have in fact been a space alien.
It's the only natural explanation, right? It's hard to tell who
originated the facts, but the two people who have listed the most are
[Matt Heath](http://matt-j-heath.livejournal.com/28576.html) and Andrew
Dolphin. My favorite two facts from these links are:

* Gauss never needs the axiom of choice, and
* Gauss didn't discover the normal distribution, nature conformed to
  his will.

I thought I would give it a go as well. So here are 20 original Gauss
facts coined by me this evening in a state of tiredness. Please keep in
mind that if you understand at least 3 of these, you're every bit as
much of a geek as I am. Fair warning.

* Gauss can trisect an angle with a straightedge and compass.
* Gauss can get to the other side of a MÃ¶bius strip.
* "Uncountably Infinite" was a phrase coined to explain the
  intelligence of Gauss.
* There are no Fermat Primes greater than 65,537 because Gauss saw that
  Fermat was on to something, and well...he put an end to that.
* For Gauss, arithmetic is consistent AND complete.
* It only takes Gauss 4 minutes to sing "Aleph-Null Bottles of Beer on
  the Wall".
* When Gauss tells you that he's lying, he's telling the truth.
* Gauss once played himself in a zero-sum game and won $50.
* For Gauss, point nine repeating equals whatever he wants it to equal.
* Gauss did not prove theorems, he simply stared at them until they
  yielded their solutions.
* Occam's Razor - The principle stating that the explanation of any
  phenomenon is equal to the explanation that came out of Gauss' mouth.
* Gauss drinks his beer from a Klein bottle.
* For Gauss, there are no indefinite integrals.
* Gauss once started falling asleep in his complex analysis class. The
  result...singularities.
* Imaginary numbers are simply those that Gauss has not deemed worthy of
  existence.
* The shortest distance between two points is Gauss.
* Once, while playing chess, Gauss solved the Knights Problem in six
  moves.
* Gauss is neither a Frequentist nor a Bayesian. For Gauss, the
  probability is always 1.
* Fermat once made Gauss angry. The result...Fermat's Last Theorem.
* In Gauss' mind, there is no such branch of mathematics as "Number
  Theory". This is because he knows it as "Number Facts".
