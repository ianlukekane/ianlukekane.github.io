So I certainly won't be covering any new ground by bringing up the
debate of whether mathematics is created or discovered. There are plenty
of resources online covering this topic. Some of the better ones I've
read are
[here](http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/math99/math99117.htm) and
[here](http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2008/04/is-mathematics.html).
I've been thinking about this question over the past day given the
Radiolab program I mention in [my last post.](/archives/151) Suffice is
it to say that Plato certainly believed that mathematics was discovered,
as evidenced through his
[theory of forms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms). While
thinking over the issue, I remembered an
[interview](http://discovermagazine.com/2008/jul/16-is-the-universe-actually-made-of-math/article_view?b_start:int=2&-C=)
that I had read earlier this year in
[Discover Magazine](http://discovermagazine.com/) with
[Max Tegmark](http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/), an Associate
Professor of Physics at MIT. Though most of his works centers around
conventional cosmology, he has some interesting theories about the
universe, and how it is physically composed of mathematics. As Max puts
it in the interview, "Mathematical things actually exist, and they are
actually physical reality". In this sense, he doesn't align himself with
Plato's theory of forms given that mathematics IS reality, rather than
mathematical forms existing in some ideal way outside of reality. The
interview is informative from a cosmological perspective as well,
particuarly in regard to the four levels of multiverse he describes.
