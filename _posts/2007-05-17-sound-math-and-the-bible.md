I'm usually quite interested in the attempts of individuals to apply
math to the Bible, and the
[Church Hopping](http://www.churchhopping.com/) blog has a fun little
[article](http://www.churchhopping.com/)about some people that are
actually using interesting mathematical principles on the text of the
Bible. Check it out.

**UPDATE:** Daniel from the Logos Blog has contacted me about a great
post over on that site. As he said, "Thought you might be interested in
today's Logos Blog post looking at The Top 50 People in the Bible and
using the IBM Many Eyes visualization. Cool thing is that anyone can
play around with the charts and data..." Check it out
[here](http://blog.logos.com/archives/2007/05/top_50_people_i_1.html).
