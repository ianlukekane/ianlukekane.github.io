Memory is a strange thing. I was thinking about this the other night in
the context of a few simple math facts that have somehow always alluded
my memory. For instance, whenever I have to mentally compute either 7+5
or 8+5 I really have to **think** about it. I'm not quite sure why. My
conjecture is that I was absent from primary school on that particular
day, and simply never recovered. I had a similar experience with the
lower-case cursive letter "k".

Does anyone else out there have a similar experience? I'm sure that
this phenomenon is fairly universal. Science is teaching us some amazing
and unexpected stuff about how the mind works, and so I suppose that
it's not surprising that sometimes "easy" facts escape us.
