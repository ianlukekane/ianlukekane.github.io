As an artistic diversion, I decided to search
[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) for the words "mathematics", "math", and
"probability" on [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/)
licensed photographs. The results were wonderful. Some of my favorites
are below. Click on the photos to see explanations from the authors or
