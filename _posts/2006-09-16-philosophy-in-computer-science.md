I was meandering through the [Slashdot](http://www.slashdot.org)
archives this evening and came across
[this](http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/05/27/0256248) discussion
about philosophy's role in computer science. I think the conversation is
illuminating on several levels. There are blatant IT professionals
coming from one angle versus hard-core philosophers coming from another.
While there's a lot of overlap in perspective each person tends to
accentuate a particular part of the (dis?)connection. I think the
threads are worth reading both from a professional and an academic
standpoint.

There are obvious links between the disciplines, notably the fact that
concepts such as computability were born from the work of folks like
[A.M. Turing](http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/), but I often wonder if
computer scientists think about this with any sort of regularity.
