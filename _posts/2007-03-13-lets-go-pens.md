As a lifetime resident of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, I'd like to take
this moment to express my happiness at learning that the
[Pittsburgh Penguins](http://www.pittsburghpenguins.com/) hockey
organization will be staying in the city. Thank you to
[Mario Lemieux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Lemieux) and the
countless others who put forth both effort and patience in making this
deal a reality. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, read a
little bit about the outcome of this long ordeal
[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#2006.E2.80.93present:_The_Crosby-Malkin_Era).
I grew up in a family that followed hockey closely, and I loved watching
Lemieux and company win two Stanley Cup championships for the city of
Pittsburgh in the early 90s. I'm glad that I'll be able to see more
hockey in this city! Let's go Pens!
