I've spent some time over the last week looking at resumes. I've had
about 100 or so cross my email inbox from a variety of job posting
sites, and I was reminded of a few quirks that people tend to fall into
that are not at all helpful for getting yourself a job. I've been on
both sides of the hiring manager divide, and I thought I would relate
some resume writing tips. There are a few examples given below that are
IT-centric, so feel free to fill in your own examples as you're reading.

1.   **Do not include an objective section:** Objective lines are
     always generic; they say nothing that differentiates you from
     others who are applying. I would much rather that a person has an
     overview section that includes your career highlights or technical
     capabilities. Telling me that you're "interested in using your
     skills in an innovative and challenging environment" says nothing
     and wastes precious space. Rather, tell me that you "have 5 years
     experience in data warehousing technologies, including the
     deployment of 3 large scale data cubes." The former is a statement
     that tells me nothing specific. The latter gives me a much better
     idea of who you are professionally and what you're capable of
     accomplishing.
2.   **Proofread:** Your resume is the first piece of work you've
     created that I see. Do you really expect me to trust your level of
     conscientiousness if you're not capable of adequately proofreading
     your public facing professional document? The answer should be no.
     This includes not only spelling and grammar, but consistent
     formatting.
3.   **Do not use a generic resume template:** Again, when a hiring
     manager is looking at stacks of resumes, differentiation makes a
     difference. If your resume blends in with 50 others, it's a safe
     bet that I'm not going to remember yours. It's worth your while to
     spend some time planning out the formatting of your resume for
     uniqueness.
4.   **Tell me what you've done; tell me what it accomplished:** Most
     people do the former, but few do the latter. I oftentimes read
     resume blurbs like "program effectively in C#." A sentence like
     this relates to me your skill set, but it doesn't tell me what
     you've done with this skill. A blurb like "programmed a replacement
     CRM system in C#, increasing application performance and saving the
     company $50K over the previously licensed CRM system" not only
     relays your skills, but it tells me what your skills have
     accomplished.
5.   **Use white space:** White space is capable of focusing the
     attention of the reader on particular pieces of the resume. More
     often than not, I receive what I refer to as "machine gun" resumes.
     These are resumes that use 8 point font, have 0.15in margins, and
     have full lines of text on every line. The thinking here seems to
     be that if you're able to throw every possible thing you've ever
     done or read about (or whatever) at the manager, they'll be
     impressed. Actually, it's quite the opposite. If it's difficult for
     me to focus on your resume, and there's no indication of what
     pieces of the document you'd like for me to focus on, sensory
     overload takes over and it's nearly impossible for me to remember
     anything about your resume.
6.   **Do not refer to yourself in the third person:** It sounds
     ridiculous, but I've seen this in a lot of resumes. You cannot
     vouch for yourself. By referring to yourself in the third person
     you sound silly. Do not do this.
7.   **No images:** Please don't include any images. I'm sure some
     people will disagree with this one, but I don't think that it's
     appropriate. For tech resumes, I understand that people are
     sometimes interested in including graphics that represent certain
     received certifications. While these certifications should
     certainly be listed in the resume, please exclude the graphics.
     There have been several times where people have included graphics
     for certifications that have NOTHING to do with the position
     they're applying to. And this tells me that they're simply
     blanketing job sites with resumes rather than to tailor their
     search to specific positions.

There are a lot of other recommendations I could give, but others have
already done a great job of this. Please check out these other resume
