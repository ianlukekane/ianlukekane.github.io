I've decided this year to read or reread as much of
[Bertrand Russell's](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/) work as
possible. I've been reading
[The History of Western Philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Western_Philosophy_(Russell))
and
[The Problems of Philosophy](http://www.ditext.com/russell/russell.html)
(the latter of which is now public domain), and have been trying to
digest [On Denoting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Denoting) by
reading it every few weeks. With this in mind, I was excited to recently
find a set of several articles written by Douglas Anele for
[Vanguard Online](http://www.vanguardngr.com) on Russell. They serve as
a good biographical introduction, and also provide a bit more
information than average on Russell's view of sexual ethics and
religion. Perhaps most interesting is that the essays are written from a
Nigerian perspective. They're certainly worth reading.
