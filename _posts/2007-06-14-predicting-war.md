A few days ago on
[Slashdot](http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/12/2213233&from=rss)
there was an article about a statistical model that claims to be able to
accurately predict the result of a war nearly 4 out of 5 times. Here's a
snippet from the University of Georgia's
[press release](http://www.uga.edu/news/artman/publish/printer_070611_Sullivan.shtml)
on Dr. Patricia L. Sullivan's study: "'If you know some key variables –
like the major objective, the nature of the target, whether there's
going to be another strong state that will intervene on the side of the
target and whether you'll have an ally – you can get a sense of your
probability of victory,' said Sullivan, whose study appears in the June
issue of the _Journal of Conflict Resolution_." Very interesting.
Statistics is a beautiful, and very misunderstood, field. When I hear
about claims like this my ears definitely perk up. In general, studies
like this propose that particular variables (such as a poor military
strategy) are predictive of other events (such as a military victory).
There's obviously a cause/effect chain reflected in this type of idea.
And believe it or not, there is a LOT of study in the area of
cause/effect relationships. People
like [Peter Spirtes](http://www.hss.cmu.edu/philosophy/faculty-spirtes.php)
at Carnegie Mellon University spend a lot of time studying these causal
relationships.

So while that claim that a statistical model can predict the outcome of
wars should be taken with a grain of salt, everyone should consider the
fantastic amount of research (and quality science) that is going into
these types of causal models.
