It's not very often that I blog about my hometown of Pittsburgh, but
today is one of those days. Congratulations to Pittsburgh, which will be
hosting the G-20 summit this coming September. Good stuff. Of course,
when the White House made the announcement today the media's response
was along the lines of "Whaaaaaat?!" But as a person whose lived in
Pittsburgh for a long time, I'm very excited for this positive
attention. We have a lot to offer in this city, and I'm glad that to
show that to the world.

In addition, I must say that I'm ridiculously excited to see the
Pittsburgh Penguins back in the Stanley Cup finals for the second year
in a row. Sports, of course, are one of the major reasons people know
about Pittsburgh, and between the Steelers and the Penguins, the city
has had a good run as of late. The Pens didn't pull it out last year,
but I'm feeling good for this year.

LET'S GO PENS!
