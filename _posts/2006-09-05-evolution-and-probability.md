There's an interesting
[article](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2384584&page=1) over
at [ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com) explaining that the number of
Americans buying into evolutionary theory has been in decline. The story
attributes this surge of opinion to several sources, including
"religious fundamentalism, inadequate science education, and partisan
political maneuvering". While I'm not currently interested in discussing
the relevancy of these possibilities, the article also talks about the
misuse of probability theory by creationists. Here's a snippet of the
argument:

> A bit more specifically, the standard argument goes roughly as
> follows. A very long sequence of individually improbable mutations
> must occur in order for a species or a biological process to evolve.
> If we assume these are independent events, then the probability of all
> of them occurring and occurring in the right order is the product of
> their respective probabilities, which is always an extremely tiny
> number. Thus, for example, the probability of getting a 3, 2, 6, 2,
> and 5 when rolling a single die five times is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x
> 1/6 or 1/7,776â€š one chance in 7,776.
