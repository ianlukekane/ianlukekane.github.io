<img align="left" hspace=7px src="/assets/mbset.jpg"> For those of you
interested in the [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/), a developer
named [alpheccar](http://www.alpheccar.org/) has released an application
for the device named [Mandelbrot](http://www.alpheccar.org/), which is a
fractal generation tool of the famous
[Mandelbrot set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set). It's a
fantastic little **free** application that allows the user to zoom in on
various pieces of the fractal using the typical touch screen commands of
the iPhone. Users are also able to discover
[Julia sets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set) within the fractal,
and to switch back and forth between the Mandelbrot and Julia sets.

Many color palettes are included, and the most recent version (1.3.3)
allows for palette animation, which creates a great visual effect. The
animation is relatively fast, and can be either automatically or
manually set. By selecting manual animation, users have the option of
setting a slide bar that controls both the speed and accuracy of
animation. It's also possible to save animations to the photo book on
the phone.

It's a great for education and visual entertainment. I really appreciate
that this developer took the time to develop such an application and
then to distribute it freely. That's a great gesture. For those of you
with an iPhone, a direct link to the application can be found
[here](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=285558755&mt=8).

FYI, the photo from this post was taken within the Mandelbrot
application and later exported to my computer. Good stuff. Good job,
[alpheccar](http://www.alpheccar.org/)!
