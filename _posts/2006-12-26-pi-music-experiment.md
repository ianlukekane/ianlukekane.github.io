I love when people intentionally mix together mathematics and art, and
one of the best examples of this merger that I've seen for awhile can be
found [here](http://avoision.com/experiments/pi10k). As the site itself
says, "this experiment attempts to convert the first 10,000 digits of pi
into a musical sequence." You have the ability to choose several preset
music scales, or can choose 10 notes either manually or randomly. It
takes a few minutes to play through the sequence, and the sounds are
quite transfixing. Even though this meshing of pi and music is somewhat
artificial, the result is wonderful. It's worth checking out.
