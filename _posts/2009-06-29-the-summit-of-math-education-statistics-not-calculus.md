The following [TED](http://www.ted.com) video, given by mathemagician
and professor Arthur Benjamin, embodies the best idea I've heard about
math education in a LONG time. Perhaps ever. Just as I recently posted
about how games like backgammon embody the 21st century in replacement
of games like chess for the 20th, statistics is the central branch of
mathematics for the 21st century rather than the calculus centric view
of the 20th century. If you're into math and math education, this will
probably be the best 3 minutes you'll spend today.
