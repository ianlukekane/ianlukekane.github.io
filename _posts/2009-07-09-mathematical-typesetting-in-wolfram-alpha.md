I came across a great little
[tip](http://davidbau.com/archives/2009/07/08/easy_math_typesetting.html)
on [David Bau's blog](http://davidbau.com/) today about using
[Wolfram Alpha](http://www00.wolframalpha.com/) to create quick GIF
images of mathematical formulae to be included in a blog. For example,
by typing "integrate sin x dx from x=0 to pi" into the Wolfram Alpha
search box, you're presented with both of graph of the curve as well as
a typeset version:

I've written a few times about using LaTeX in WordPress, but this is
certainly an easy way to include typeset equations in a blog. I'm not
sure why this hadn't occurred to me when I first started playing with
Wolfram Alpha, but I suppose that's why people like David write great
tips like this!
