**UPDATE:** Thanks to ll for finding attribution for this image. It
comes from [GraphJam](http://www.graphjam.com), and the pie chart is
[here](http://cheezburger.com/1834983168). The author is Jamie Schimley.
I'm looking forward to browsing through more hilarity at this link.

**ORIGINAL:** Thanks to [AdArena.net](http://www.adarena.net/) for this
one. You should check them out. They've got some great stuff posted. I'm
not sure where this picture originates, but it certainly made me laugh
out loud. If anyone has further attribution on this photo, let me know.
It's truly hilarious.
