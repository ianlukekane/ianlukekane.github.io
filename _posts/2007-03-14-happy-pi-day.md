Since today is March 14 (3.14), I'd like to wish everyone a happy pi
day. Read more about the wonderful number of pi
[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi) and
[here](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Pi.html). I'm sure that some of you
have seen the following visual representation of pi before, but this
animated gif should give everyone a refresher on exactly what pi is.
This informative animation was created by
[John Reid](http://en.wikipedia.org /wiki/User:John_Reid).
[Note: I have this animation set so that it will only loop 6 times
in total. If you'd like to see it again please refresh or restart your
browser.]
