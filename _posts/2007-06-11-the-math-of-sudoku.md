There's a wonderful article over at
[ars technica](http://arstechnica.com/journals/science.ars/2007/06/10/when-sudoku-and-mathematics-intersect)
about the mathematics of sudoku. Agnes M. Herzberg and M. Ram Murty
recently wrote an article in which they explain some of the mathematical
underpinnings of the popular puzzles. They explore several fundamental
questions such as "does a given sudoku have a unique solution?" The link
above provides a great introduction to the formal paper, and also
includes a link to the PDF version of the paper. Check it out. One of
the great tidbits from the article includes the stat that there are over
5.5 BILLION unique sudoku puzzles. Yikes. That's keep even the most
committed addicts busy for a while!
