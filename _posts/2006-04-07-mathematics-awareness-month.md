For those who don't know, April happens to be Mathematics Awareness
Month (MAM). According to the MAM website, "Mathematics Awareness Month
is held each year in April. Its goal is to increase public understanding
of and appreciation for mathematics." The organization which sponsors
this month is the Joint Policy Board for Mathematics, which "is a
collaborative effort of the American Mathematical Society, the American
Statistical Association, the Mathematical Association of America, and
the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics."

Each year has an appropriately labeled theme, and this year is no
different. 2006 is the year of Mathematics and Internet Security. There
are a few links to articles related to math and internet security on the
website, including topics such as internet voting, public key
cryptography, internet password security, computer viruses, and secure
data storage. So if you fall into the category of people who doesn't
understand what math does in the real world, read some of this stuff.
There is no escape from math, MWAHAHAHAHA!

The website for MAM can be found [here](http://www.mathaware.org/).

Happy Mathematics Awareness Month Everyone!
