If you haven't read
[this](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/12840743/porks_dirty_secret_the_nations_top_hog_producer_is_also_one_of_americas_worst_polluters/1)
article written by Jeff Tietz for
[Rolling Stone](http://www.rollingstone.com/) magazine, I highly suggest
reading it. The piece presents the pork industry through the business of
Smithfield Foods, which is the largest pork producer in America. The
article suggests that one of every four pigs in America is slaughtered
by this company. There's a lot of familiar ground covered for those who
know about industrial food production, such as the living conditions of
the pigs, unsanitary excrement levels, and animal antibiotic
consumption. The article paints a bleak picture, but manages to do so
while giving the reader a fair amount of readable statistics. There's
also a historical portion that tells of the story of Joseph Luter III,
the chairman of Smithfield Foods. It's interesting to read the economic
implications of the growth of such a large company. The keyword of the
entire article is pollution. This specific company (and others like it)
exposes nearby people and land to a copious amount of pollution. One
statistic relayed is that Smithfield's largest processing plant "dumps
more toxic waste into the nation's water each year than all but three
other industrial facilities in America." Yikes.

Part of what I like about this writing is its focus on the impact on
humanity. Oftentimes these types of stories are sad stories only from
the perspective of the animal (which is still true), but doesn't measure
the ways that businesses like Smithfield Foods are adversely influencing
human lives. Tietz focuses on the ways that pollution generated on the
farms sickens people and keeps them from leading normal lives. Fish who
used to live in the areas waterways are now dead, ending the employment
of countless local fishermen. Workers in the hog plants die while
becoming overwhelmed with the toxic fumes they breathe. People living in
the area have contaminated drinking and bath water. The list goes on.

I've never been the type of vegetarian who gets angry with omnivores.
But articles like this one give me reason to keep up my chosen eating
habits. Our current methods of food production are not sustainable. When
millions of gallons of pig shit per year are dumped into our rivers,
that is NOT sustainable. When pigs are pumped full of drugs that breed
antibiotic resistant germs that make people sick, that is NOT
sustainable. And on and on. Okay, my rant is over. Read the article,
it's full of information that people should know.
