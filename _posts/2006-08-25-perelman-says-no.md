I'm sure most of you have heard by now, but on Tuesday
[Grigori Perelman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Perelman)
refused to accept the Fields Medal for his work on the
Poincaré Conjecture. I'm sure there are people with all sorts of
opinions about this, but the
[First Post](http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?menuID=1&subID=692&WT.srch=1)
has an interesting take on the situation. Also, if you're looking for
another explanation of why any of this matters anyway, I suggest reading
Jordan Ellenberg's Slate article
