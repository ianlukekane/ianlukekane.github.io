If you haven't yet been introduced to the
[Stuff White People Like](http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/) blog, you're
in for a treat. There is a new article on statistics that you can read
[here](http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/2008/06/25/winner-5/). Basically,
the blog is comprised of witty, yet strangely accurate descriptions
of...well...things that white people like. It's truly hilarious. For
instance, take the first line of this article, "White people hate math.
If you want to befriend white people, mention 'that weird Asian calculus
teacher who drew perfect circles' and how much you hated his classâ€¦"
Awesome.
