As I look through articles that I've bookmarked over the last many
months, I realized that I had saved two that concerned machines that
were built to interact with themselves in novel ways. I find this
self-interaction quite entertaining for a reason I can't quite pinpoint.
Perhaps it's because I generally think of a machine as a black box that
takes an input and produces an output. I tend to segregate the input and
the output entirely from the black box. But these machines are built
only with the purpose of performing an action on themselves. They are
input, output, and black box. And I find that extremely entertaining.

First, take this iteration of
[Claude Shannon's "Ultimate Machine"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon#Hobbies_and_inventions),
whose sole purpose when turned on is to immediately turn itself back off
again:

As the video explains, you can find plans for building your own machine
of the same type at
[Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Most-Useless-Machine/).
It should be said that I was introduced to this machine via
[Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net) much earlier when they directed
me [here](http://60035pserver.com/LeaveMeAloneBoxWebsite/). These folks
call the machine the "Leave Me Alone Box", and there are several videos
on the site devoted to showing different fan-made machines in action. It
looks like this site will also eventually sell a kit which allows you to
build your own box. Kevin Kelly also has an
[article](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/03/the_unspeakable.php)
that gives some history about this "Ultimate Machine".

Secondly, take [Michael Kontopoulos'](http://www.mkontopoulos.com/)
machines that are built only with the task of nearly knocking themselves
over:

The artist explains his intentions on his website as trying "to capture
and sustain the exact moment of impending catastrophe and endlessly
repeat it." I love it! So close to falling, and yet so far away! There
are lots of other interesting projects to find on Michael's website as
well.
