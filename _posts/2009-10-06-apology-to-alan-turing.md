I'm rather late on the draw in regard to this note, but I just wanted
to say that I was profoundly glad to hear that the Prime Minister of
England released a
[letter of apology](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8249792.stm) on September
10 recognizing [Alan Turing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)
for his monumental "contribution to humankind", including work in
computation, mathematics, and code-breaking.

Despite his contributions, Turing was convicted under English
homophobic laws and sentenced to chemical castration. As PM Brown
writes, "In 1952, he was convicted of 'gross indecency' - in effect,
tried for being gay." Given the choice between going to prison and
undergoing hormone treatments, he chose the latter. Less than three
years later Turing was found dead, apparently the result of a cyanide
overdose. His death was judged to be a suicide.

While the note obviously cannot change the past, I'm glad to see the
British government deliver the note. And I'm extremely proud of those
individuals who lobbied the government to acknowledge this terrible
mistake. Again, as PM Brown wrote, "So on behalf of the British
government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan's work I am
very proud to say: we're sorry, you deserved so much better." So very
true.
