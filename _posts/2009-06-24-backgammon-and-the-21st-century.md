In 1997, chess champion Gary Kasparov was beaten in a 6-point match
against a computer. It was the first time this had ever happened. The
computer, named
[Deep Blue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)),
was developed by IBM after some Carnegie Mellon University graduates
joined the company. Here's what Wikipedia has to say about the hardware
computing power of Deep Blue:

Brute force. That's how the computer got the job done. Of course, it's
never that simple. But there is one thing that can be said for certain:
If you lose a game of chess, it is because you were outplayed. Plain and
simple. And I think it's for this reason that chess became an apt
metaphor for modernist notions of intelligence. Stereotypically
speaking, if you ask a person the question of what game smart people
play, I would guess that chess would be the most common answer in the
western world (perhaps Go in the eastern world). The fate of this game
is in the hand of the players entirely. There is no chance involved,
with the one exception of which player plays first.

As a child, I had a hard time enjoying games that involved a substantial
amount of probability. "What's the point," I thought, "of playing a game
skillfully if it's possible for me to lose at the last possible moment
due to a bad roll of the dice or a badly dealt card?" But as I've grown
older, I've come to enjoy games like this MORE on average than
straightforward skill games like chess. Enter backgammon.

For those of you who don't know backgammon, I suggest checking out the
Wikipedia page [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backgammon).
Backgammon has been played for 5,000 years, and has evolved
substantially over that time. For example, of the additions to the game,
the doubling cube, drastically changed play and was introduced less than
100 years ago. Backgammon is not like chess. In a single game of
backgammon, it's quite possible for a novice to beat a master due to
elements of chance. Said another way, it's possible to play the best
possible game of backgammon you can based on your dice rolls and still
lose. And this is the aspect of the game that makes it an apt metaphor
for the 21st century. While the 20th century dealt with certainty, the
21st will deal with probability.

And this is not to say that games like backgammon are somehow more
subjective than games like chess. There are some amazing machine
learning techniques used to study the game (e.g.
[TD-Gammon](http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/11/node2.html)), and
there are quite a few computer programs, such as
[GNU Backgammon](http://www.gnubg.org/), that use these techniques to
outplay human opponents. Poker games like
[Texas Hold'em](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em) also
involve an element of probability, and have grown wildly popular over
the last many years. And those of you who know poker know that there are
rules that govern "right" playing. Though the cards dictate play, there
are strategies that maximize gain and minimize risk. The same is true of
backgammon. And with the game popping up in popular culture a bit more,
like in the television show
[Lost](http://lostpedia.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page), I can only see
backgammon growing in popularity.
