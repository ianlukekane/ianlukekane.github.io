This is perhaps one of the most amazing videos I've every watched on the
Internet. I was literally left speechless. I can accomplish certain
small feats of mental math, but this is absolutely unbelievable.
[Arthur Benjamin](http://www.math.hmc.edu/~benjamin/index.html) shows us
some inspiring abilities of the human mind. I'm sure he has spent a fair
amount of time learning his methods, and that to him his abilities are
perfectly normal (in some sense!), but it's great to watch someone with
this talent. I highly recommend watching the video in its entirety.
