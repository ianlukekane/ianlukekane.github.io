I came across
[this](http://danielhaggard.com/17/five-great-puzzles-and-paradoxes-to-tickle-the-mind/)
wonderful introduction to several famous paradoxes quite a while ago,
but haven't taken the time to inform you all about it. Daniel Haggard
presents a non-technical explanation of five age-old paradoxes that have
both delighted and confused humanity. It's a very accessible read and I
recommend it for everyone interested in the strange logical conundrums
that surround us. I particularly enjoy his section on Newcomb's Paradox,
which boggles my brain every time I think about it. Honestly, I'm glad
that paradoxes exist. I mean, nothing I say is true, right?
