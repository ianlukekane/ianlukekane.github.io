I'm trying to fill this autumn with plenty of seasonal activities, and
so I've decided to try to read the complete works of
[Edgar Allan Poe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe#Cryptography)
during the month of October. I've also been reading some biographical
information about the writer, and must admit that I had never heard
about the cryptographic challenge that Poe issued to readers in the
_Alexander's Weekly Messenger_ in December 1839. R. Morelli has a
fantastic overview of this cipher challenge
[here](http://starbase.trincoll.edu/~crypto/historical/poe.html). In
sum, Poe proposed that "he could solve any simple substitution cipher
that readers of the magazine cared to submit.
A [simple substitution cipher](http://starbase.trincoll.edu/~crypto/historical/substitution.html)
is one in which the same symbol stands for the same letter of the
alphabet in the concealed message."

It appears that Poe did very well with the challenge.

Also, fans of Poe's writing will know about the short story
_[The Gold Bug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gold-Bug)_, and how
this story of a treasure hunt relies on the solving of a cryptogram.
Poe's works are in the public domain, so it's possible to read this
story online through Google Books
[here](http://books.google.com/books?id=_B8eAAAAMAAJ&dq=the%20gold%20bug%20edgar%20allan%20poe&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q=&f=false),
or to download the story (amongst others) from Project Gutenberg
[here](http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2147).
