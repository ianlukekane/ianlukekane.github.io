A friend let me know quite a while ago about
[this](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89300369&sc=emaf)
story presented on NPR's site entitled "Mathematicians Explain Tape's
Tendency to Tear". It's an explanation of a recent
[Pedro Reis](http://web.mit.edu/preis/www/) article in the journal
_Nature Materials_ describing the annoying tendancy of tape to narrow
while unpeeling it from the roll. As the article explains, Reis' work
"could help engineers test thin films for strength and reliability" The
audio of the story is also available on the NPR site.

I love this story because I can imagine Pedro first thinking about this
problem while unpeeling a roll of tape. I don't know if the inspiration
actually came this way, but its a great mental image that conveys the
idea that some of the most interesting problems to solve are right under
our noses.

Here's the abstract of the paper from Dr. Reis's website:

> Thin adhesive films have become increasingly important in applications
> involving packaging, coating or for advertising. Once a ﬁlm is adhered
> to a substrate, flaps can be detached by tearing and peeling, but they
> narrow and collapse in pointy shapes. Similar geometries are observed
> when peeling ultrathin films grown or deposited on a solid substrate,
> or skinning the natural protective cover of a ripe fruit. In this
> work, we have shown that the detached flaps have perfect triangular
> shapes with a well-defined vertex angle; this is a signature of the
> conversion of bending energy into surface energy of fracture and
> adhesion. In particular, this triangular shape of the tear encodes the
> mechanical parameters related to these three forms of energy and could
> form the basis of a quantitative assay for the mechanical
> characterization of thin adhesive films, nanofilms deposited on
> substrates or fruit skin.
