[Kurt Gödel](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/) died 31 years
ago today. From the little I've read of his life, and from the even
smaller amount that I truly grasp from his work, I believe that only in
reality could such a fantastic and somewhat lamentable figure come to
be. He was included in the infamous
[Vienna Circle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Circle), but was
himself a Platonist. He was shy, reclusive, and prone to illnesses both
physical and mental. He was a friend to Albert Einstein. And he shook
the world of mathematics in a way that destroyed the
[Hilbert program](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hilbert-program/).
In simple terms, he showed that the mechanization of mathematics could
not be fully automated, or that mathematics was not something that could
be neatly placed in a box and tied up with a bow.

[John W Dawson Jr.](http://plus.maths.org/issue39/features/dawson/)
explains the first of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems by saying, "In his
1931 paper Gödel showed that, no matter how you formulate the axioms for
number theory, there will always be some statement that is true of the
natural numbers, but that can't be proved. (That is, objects that obey
the axioms of number theory but fail to behave like the natural numbers
in some other respects do exist.)"

[John Von Neumann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann),
certainly one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, had
the following to say in a letter shortly after the publication of the
Incompleteness theorems:

> Thus today I am of the opinion that 1. Gödel has shown the
> unrealizability of Hilbert's program. 2. There is no more reason to
> reject intuitionism (if one disregards the aesthetic issue, which in
> practice will also for me be the decisive factor). Therefore I
> consider the state of the foundational discussion in Königsberg to be
> outdated, for Gödel's fundamental discoveries have brought the
> question to a completely different level.

Another way of summing this up is to say, "this work has changed the
way we must view mathematics." I have to imagine that the fame of the
majority of famous people peaks in the prime of life, only to wane with
time and death. Only the smallest number of people see their influence
grow with time, as reflection shows their achievements to be truly
monumental. Gödel, I believe, sits comfortably in the latter group.

Obviously, I have a bit of a crush.
