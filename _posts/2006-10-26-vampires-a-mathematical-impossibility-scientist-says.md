Well good grief, how can I possibly improve on this headline? In the
spirit of Halloween, check out
[this](http://www.livescience.com/4257-vampires-mathematical-impossibility-scientist.html)
article over at [Live Science](http://www.livescience.com), which
attempts to deny the existence of vampires through some simple
exponential reasoning.

I have always enjoyed Halloween. It conjures up images of
mischievousness in my mind, rather than images of gore or fear. Then
again, I'm a sucker for the mysterious, so Halloween fits that category
quite nicely. Also, we're coming up on All-Saints day as well, which you
can read about [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Saints). At any
rate, Emily and I will be passing out candy at our house this Halloween,
so stop by! Also, thanks to my mom for this article, who recently
celebrated her birthday on one of the most mysterious days of the year:
Friday, October 13!
