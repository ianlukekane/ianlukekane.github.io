Fractals are beautiful things. If you don't know what a fractal is, you
should read [this](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Fractal.html) for a
general overview. The most famous fractal (and one of the most
mathematically simple) is the Mandelbrot Set, which is named after its
discoverer
[Benoit Mandelbrot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beno%C3%AEt_Mandelbrot).
For awhile I've wanted to include some sort of video of the Mandelbrot
Set "in action". The following video shows what happens when you "zoom
in" on a portion of this fractal. It's quite interesting. Suffice is it
to say that if I ever fall into a bottomless pit, I hope that bottomless
pit is like falling into the Mandelbrot Set. At least that way there
would be good stuff to look at. There are several other videos out there
on the web that show other perspectives of zooming into this particular
fractal, so if you like what you see here head over to
[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) or what not and search for some more!
The math rock song in the video was written by Jonathan Coulton. If you
listen to the lyrics they actually explain a little bit about how to
graph this particular fractal. Check out his website
[here](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/lyrics/mandelbrot-set).
[**Warning: For those of you with sensitive ears, the song that
accompanies the video has a few curse words scattered throughout!**]
