I've seen [Craig Damrauer's New Math](http://www.morenewmath.com/all/) pictures across a bunch of different places on the web, and they always make me take pause. A lot of them are downright hilarious, while others are more thoughtful. Check this one out:

I actually laughed out loud the first time I saw this. And then I thought about pirates in recent news history. And then I thought about Pirates of the Caribbean. And then I realized that in my brain there was a giant chasm between these two impressions.
