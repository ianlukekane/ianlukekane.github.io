It looks like the New York Times has a story today about the proof of
the Poincaré Conjecture. You can read the article
[here](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/15/science/15math.html?_r=1&ref=science&oref=slogin).
I just love how the media always plays up the "insatiably crazed
introvert" image of mathematicians, in this case overly dramatizing
Grigory Perelman, the Russian mathematician responsible for much of the
proof methodology. I wrote about this a while back, but this article
definitely gives a much more in-depth explanation of the history of the
conjecture. Happy reading everyone!
