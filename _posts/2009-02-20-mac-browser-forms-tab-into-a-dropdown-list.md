It has always driven me totally crazy on my Mac that drop down lists
were skipped when tabbing through web forms. This is especially
infuriating for at least two reasons: 1) I've never heard of this issue
in Windows, and 2) Almost every web form that you fill out includes a
drop down list for either state or country, which means you have to
spend the extra time to use the mouse to move back into the list and
find the correct value. Just so that you know, it's easy to change this
behavior. Open **System Preferences** and go to the **Keyboard & Mouse**
section. Toward the bottom of the screen, you should see the option for
"**In windows and dialogs, press Tab to move the keyboard focus
between:**". Change the value from **Text boxes and lists only** to
**All controls**, and you're ready to roll. The screen shot provided
below will show you exactly what you're looking for. Hopefully this
saves at least one of you out there some frustration!
