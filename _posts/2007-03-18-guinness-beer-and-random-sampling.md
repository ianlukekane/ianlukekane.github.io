As if we didn't already have enough to thank
[Guinness](http://www.guinness.com) for, I learned something very
interesting today about a connection between this fine beer and
statistics. I'm reading the book "Randomness" by
[Deborah Bennett](http://web.njcu.edu/sites/FACULTY/dbennett/Content/default.asp)
([Amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/Randomness-Deborah-J-Bennett/dp/0674107454)),
which is an introductory text concerning the basics of probability
theory and statistics. It's an accessible read, and contains several
nuggets of interesting historical information. I suggest checking it out
if you're interested in this sort of thing. Here's what Dr. Bennett has
to say concerning the Guinness connection to statistics:

"The best-known early demonstration of a random sampling experiment was
performed by William Sealy Gosset, a research chemist working for the
Arthur Guinness Son and Company Ltd. in Dublin. Gosset was studying the
relationship between the quality of Guinness beer and various factors in
the beer's production. The brewery was continually experimenting with
soil conditions and grain variety that might produce improvements in
crop yield, and Gosset was intent on bringing all the benefits of
statistics to the brewery's agricultural experiments."

In short, Gosset discovered the t-distribution while working on this
problem for Guinness. If you've ever taken an introductory course in
statistics you'll probably remember working with t-tests. They're a way
of correctly analyzing small sample sizes, where "small" usually means
samples less than size 30. There are some other fun facets of Gosset's
work on this problem, including the fact that he published his findings
in papers under the pseudonym of _Student_. Read Gosset's Wikipedia page
[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sealey_Gosset) for other
general pieces of information.
