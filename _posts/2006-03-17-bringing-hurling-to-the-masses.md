On this St. Patrick's Day I'd like to take a moment to let everyone out
there know about the wonderful sport of Irish hurling. It's the national
sport of Ireland, and if you haven't heard of it then you're in for a
treat. It's often described as the fastest field game in the world. If
you'd like a terse explanation of the game think field hockey on a rugby
field. It'd actually be much easier for you to watch some video clips of
the game in action, so if you're interested check out some clips
[here](http://www.rebelgaa.com/videoclips/2005videoclips.asp) and
[here](http://www.rebelgaa.com/videoclips/2004clips.asp). These snippets
are from the All Ireland Hurling Finals of the years 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Cork, the county in which I once lived for a summer, now
stands as the All-Ireland hurling champions. Happy St. Patrick's Day
everyone! Anyone caught today drinking light beers will be punished most
severely!
