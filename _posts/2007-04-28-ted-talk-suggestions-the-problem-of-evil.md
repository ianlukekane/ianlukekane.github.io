I don't know how many of you are familiar with the TED conference, but
if you don't know anything about it I suggest checking out their website
[here](http://www.ted.com/). The yearly conference focuses on
technology, entertainment, and design, and it defines its mission as
"spreading ideas". You can watch most of the conference talks on this
website. There are some serious gems that you should watch. I suggest
the following:

  * [Hans Rosling: Debunking third-world myths with the best stats you've ever seen](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/92)
  * [Dan Dennet: Can we know our own minds?](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/102)
  * [Richard Dawkins: The universe is queerer than we can suppose](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/98)
  * [Majora Carter: Greening the ghetto](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/53)

Also, I just watched the following presentation made by the Reverend Tom
Honey. As the brief synopsis of the talk indicates, "It's a classic
problem in theology: How can the existence of evil be reconciled with a
God who is supposed to be all-loving, all-knowing and all-powerful? Many
Christian thinkers have attempted answers to this question. In the days
following the thousands of personal tragedies recorded during the South
Asian tsunami of 2004, Tom Honey pondered those answers and found them
wanting. Instead, he penned his own, personal, and sometimes dramatic
response to the tsunami. This is a courageous talk for a Church of
England vicar to have given. It concludes that certain traditional
concepts of God just won't do ... and calls for believers and
nonbelievers alike to dig deeper in their quest for truth."

I was extremely impressed with his thoughts. None of them were
particularly new to me, but this talk does provide a good theological
redux of the issues involved in the current debate over the problem of
evil. It's an extremely personal and honest appraisal of thought, and I
enjoyed listening to it.
