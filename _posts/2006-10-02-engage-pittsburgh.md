I've been meaning to write out my thoughts on the
[Engage Pittsburgh](http://www.engagepittsburgh.org/) event that Emily
and I attended a few weeks back. This event, sponsored by
[The Sprout Fund](http://www.sproutfund.org/), was meant to serve as an
idea-roundup for ways that individuals wanted to change the city of
Pittsburgh. There were ideas fitting many categories, including
transportation, economic development, housing, arts & culture, etc.
Based upon the ideas that came out of the event The Sprout Fund will be
issuing around $100,000 to help with the implementation of some of these
initiatives. If you'd like to see one of the ideas I helped to conceive
you can link to it [here](http://www.engagepittsburgh.org/node/177). The
idea centers around changing the Pittsburgh busways so that bikers could
use them as well. Though there would definitely be some infrastructure
issues I think an idea along these lines would be extremely beneficial
for the city.

The whole event, though noble in intent, was lacking in several ways.
First, Emily and I were immediately split up. Though we came to the
event to experience and brainstorm ideas together the staff separated
parties that came together. Though I could understand the intent of this
procedure there was no advance warning that such a split would occur.
This was surprise one of the day.

Though I was really hoping to engage personally with individuals there
wasn't much time for such interactions. The whole event was extremely
structured, and we were meant to keep a stringent schedule. In that
sense the event felt extremely inorganic. While there was a large
contingent of people who knew one another (the "in" crowd), I was not
one of these people. It seemed that both the staff and "in" individuals
weren't interested in getting to know me. I was saddened by this
reality. But toward the end of the day I did get to interact with a few
people a bit more fully, so I wouldn't call the day a relational waste.

I commend The Sprout Fund for their initiative on this event, but I
thought that the details could've been carried out in a friendlier and
more efficient manner. As a silly example, though there was a lunch
provided only about 25% of them were vegetarian. But this was an event
for the GRANOLA crowd of Pittsburgh. I'm being a bit facetious but you
get my point. By the time Emily and I got there the vegetarian option
had vanished. And I know that a lot of other folks experienced the same
problem.

I'm hoping that the event actually advances change in the city. I'm
weary that there was a lot energy generated that will vanish into the
ether. Hopefully I'll be proved wrong on that point.
