Ars Technica has an interesting
[article](http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/06/irrational-markets-people-reject-free-money-out-of-anger.ars)
today about a paper about to be released in the
[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](http://www.pnas.org/)
(PNAS) about variations to an experiment in Game Theory called the
Ultimatum Game. As the Ars article explains,

> The basic rules of the Ultimatum Game are simple. One person is given
> a stack of cash, and told to divide it between themselves and a second
> party. That second party is then given the chance to accept or reject
> the offer; if it's rejected, neither of them get any money. Clearly,
> any of this free money should be better than nothing, so under
> assumptions of strictly rational behavior, you might expect all offers
> to be accepted.

It turns out that tweaking some of the premises of this game leads to
some interesting results in terms of human rationality, economic
systems, and guilt. I highly recommend reading the article in its
entirety. Also, if you're interested in reading the abstract of actual
paper itself, it's available on the PNAS website
[here](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/06/26/0900636106.abstract).
It also looks like the full paper is available in PDF format if you'd
like to read it. Not sure how long it will be available, but it's there
now. Toshio Yamagishi, the lead author, has a website
[here](http://lynx.let.hokudai.ac.jp/members/yamagishi/english/).
