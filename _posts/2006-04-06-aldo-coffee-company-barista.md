Aldo Coffee Company is probably responsible for brewing the best coffee
in Pittsburgh. It's located in Mt. Lebanon, and is less than a five
minute walk from the Mt. Lebanon trolley stop. They take coffee quite
seriously in this cozy place, and they also happen to serve some
scrumptous Panini sandwiches as well. The owners are friendly, the decor
is inviting, and the drinks are just plain good (my favorite so far is
the Cappuccino Aldo).

Also, it just so happens that the establishment boasts as a barista Ms.
Belle Battista, who will be traveling to Charlotte this weekend to
compete in the United States Barista Championship. In other words, she
makes some dang good coffee. Actually, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
newspaper wrote an article about her yesterday. You can read that
article [here](http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06095/679368-51.stm). So
if you're looking for some good coffee, I highly suggest checking this
place out.

Good luck and happy brewing this weekend Belle!
