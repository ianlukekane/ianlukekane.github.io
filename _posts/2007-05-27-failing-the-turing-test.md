I can't remember exactly how I came across
[this](https://www.msu.edu/~pennock5/courses/ALife/Striegel_Failed_Turing_test.pdf)
hilarious article, but I highly suggest checking it out (warning: it
contains what some might deem slightly offensive language). It's all
about a guy named Jason who keeps being mistaken for a robot in his
instant messaging conversations. It's highly amusing. For those of you
who don't know, Alan Turing proposed a test in 1950 to gauge whether or
not a computer can think. Here's briefly (and incompletely) how the test
goes:

1.   Recruit two humans, one to participate in the test and the other
     to judge it.
2.   Recruit a computer whose inventor claims it can think.
3.   Put the human judge in a room that contains only a device capable
     of receiving and sending text messages.
4.   Have the human judge type questions into this device which she
     would like to ask the human participant and "thinking" computer.
5.   One question at a time, the "thinking" computer and human
     participant answer these questions by writing out text answers and
     transmitting them back to the device in the room with the judge.
6.   If the judge cannot determine through the answers to these
     questions who is the human participant and who is the "thinking"
     computer, the computer wins and passes the test. In other words,
     since the computer tricked the judge, it can be said to think.

This is a simplistic version of the test, but it's definitely the gist
of it. In Turing's paper he guessed that by the year 2000 a computer
would have been built that was able to pass the test. He was wrong. Even
now, in 2007, a computer hasn't been built that has consistently passed
this test. Interesting, huh? The full text of Turing's paper which
details the Turing test can be read
[here](http://loebner.net/Prizef/TuringArticle.html). The article is
called "Computing Machinery and Intelligence". It's an accessible paper
for anyone with these types of interests. And for more information
regarding the Turing test, check out its Wikipedia article
