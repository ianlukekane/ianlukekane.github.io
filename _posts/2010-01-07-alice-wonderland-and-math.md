Having just completed both of Lewis Carol's books concerning Alice and
her adventures in Wonderland, the recent Boing Boing
[post](http://www.boingboing.net/2009/12/16/mathematical-mockery.html)
about Melanie Bayley and her research into the idea that scenes were
added into the narrative after the initial draft in order to mock new
math of the day, namely symbolic algebra. As one example, Bayley likens
the Mad Hatter tea party scene to the concept of the
[quaternion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) introduced by
[William Rowan Hamilton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton).
Without giving away the punchline, Bayley paints an interesting picture
of why the three guests at the tea party are stuck at their table,
constantly swapping seats. Read the full article at New Scientist
[here](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427391.600-alices-adventures-in-algebra-wonderland-solved.html?full=true),
which gives many more examples of how Carol lampooned the so-called "new
math". Who likes imaginary numbers, anyway?
