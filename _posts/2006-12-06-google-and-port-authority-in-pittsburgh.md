One of the major gripes I've heard people make about the
[Port Authority](http://www.portauthority.org/paac/) transit system in
Pittsburgh is that it's impossible to plan trips. The best method is
generally to talk with people who have been using public transportation
for longer than you have. Port Authority set up a route search engine
through its website about a year ago, but it was downright terrible. I
know this system can still be accessed, but I've been disillusioned
enough by it to forget about its existence. Well, it looks like Google
has taken a step in the right direction and created
[Google Transit](http://www.google.com/transit), which is a product
currently available in 8 U.S. cities, including Pittsburgh. It's exactly
what it sounds like it would be: a way to search public transportation
lines in the city of Pittsburgh. I haven't thoroughly tested it yet, but
the interface is basically an extension of
[Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/maps). Good stuff. I suppose that
having Google in Pittsburgh will lead to this type of perk. I'm sure
there are some kinks to be worked out, but I'm EXTREMELY happy about
this development. I generally think that public transportation is a
great way to travel, and one of the hindrances has definitely been route
planning, at least for this city. This type of online aid should help
with this problem. Now if we can only work on this price system...
