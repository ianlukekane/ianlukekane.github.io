Ever since I heard about [Logicomix](http://www.logicomix.com), a
graphic novel about the 20th century search for the foundations of
mathematics, I was extremely excited to read it. And I'm happy to say
that now I've finished it, it most certainly met, and exceeded, my
rather high expectations.

First, I think it's appropriate to explain what Logicomix is, and what
it is not. First, it is a work of fiction. The authors are clear on this
point, and explicitly spell it out in the epilogue. This graphic novel
is meant to be a piece of art, not a pristine account of history. But
its account of history will definitely give the reader an accurate
outline of what happened in mathematics in the 20th century, even if the
details aren't entirely accurate, and even if certain liberties are
taken in order to present a story which engages the reader in its
narrative format.

Logicomix tells the story of 20th century mathematics by using Bertrand
Russell as a narrator. The story is framed as a talk which Russell is
giving to an audience directly before Britain's entrance into World War
II. He traces his life's story from childhood through his work as an
activist, and along the way we meet the familiar set of characters from
that day, including Frege, Whitehead, Gödel, Wittgenstein, Cantor, etc.

The story is compelling. The authors,
[Apostolos Doxiadis](http://www.apostolosdoxiadis.com/) and
[Christos Papadimitriou](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~christos/), do an
amazing job of following Russell's career, and of showing the
personality and human struggle behind a quest centered around the
abstract notion of truth. While most of the characters are obsessed with
matters of the brain, the story also focuses on the heart as well. For
instance, Logicomix does a good job explaining Russell's obsession with
madness, and his fear associated with it. There is also an aspect of
meta-story in Logicomix, whereby the authors themselves appear
throughout to drive home points and debate various tidbits of the story.
This is an interesting aspect that mirrors to some extent Gödel's
meta-logical statements. I thought this was a good touch.

The art, done by
[Alecos Papadatos](http://alecospapadatos.blogspot.com/) and Annie Di
Donna, is stunning. As a material object, this graphic novel is
**beautiful**. I'm a huge proponent of quality, and everything about the
novel breathes quality. From the art to the color to the fonts to even
the dimensions of the page and panels, Logicomix is extremely well
engineered. Kudos to them both!

As a work of historical fiction, this story should appeal both to
lovers of logic and mathematics as well as those who enjoy a fantastic
story. The authors are using history to drive home what I believe to be
an accurate and well-stated point, which I will not divulge here. If
there are any flaws, I would point out two. First, Gödel is treated
somewhat like a
[deus ex machina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina). Rather
than providing more exposition into his life, the authors are content to
have him come and go quite quickly, though I must admit that I LOVED the
first panel in which he appears. It's probably my favorite panel in the
entire work. Secondly, there's nothing about Turing, other than to
mention him in the meta-story toward the end. One cannot truly
understand logic without knowing something about computability. Granted,
it seems that a sequel may be a possibility which begins with Turing and
ends in the 21st century, but only time will tell. Until then, Logicomix
comes as highly suggested.
