Voila! Turing machine muffins! What a delicious idea. If I had used this
method while learning about these universal machines I probably would've
been much happier. What's a Turing Machine, you ask? Read about them
[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) and
[here](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-machine/). Check out
other pictures of muffin madness

[Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net) for this info!
