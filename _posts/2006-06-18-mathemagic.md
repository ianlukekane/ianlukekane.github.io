There's a great
[article](http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/06/infinite_jest.php)
over at [Seed Magazine](http://www.seedmagazine.com/) about the seventh
annual "Gathering for Gardner" conference, which in short celebrates the
literal magic of mathematics. As the write-up explains, the Gathering
for Gardner conference is "a bi-annual pilgrimage honoring Martin
Gardner, who, from 1957 to 1981, enraptured mathematicians and
scientists, hobbyists and professionals, magicians and puzzlists and
skeptics alike with his "Mathematical Games" column in
[_Scientific American_](http://www.sciam.com/)."

I highly recommend reading their account of the conference, which is
highly entertaining. Ah, mystery and magic!
