I rarely post to issues of the
[Carnival of Mathematics](http://carnivalofmathematics.wordpress.com/)
from my blog, and I really don't have a good reason for it. The 54th
edition was released yesterday on Todd and Vishal's blog
[here](http://topologicalmusings.wordpress.com/2009/07/05/the-54th-carnival-of-mathematics/),
and there are some interesting posts. First, I enjoyed the post and the
comments on the GÃ¶del's ontological proof, which
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_ontological_proof)
tells us "is a formalization of
[Saint Anselm's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anselm_of_Canterbury)
[ontological argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument)
for God's existence." Secondly, there is a link to The Lebombo Bone,
which may be the oldest mathematical artifact in the world. Good stuff.
Check out the carnival itself for links to these posts.

I must admit that the contents of these carnivals I enjoy the most are
ones that take an interesting piece of the math world and make it
accessible to a wide reaching audience. Which, I suppose, is generally
what I try to do on this blog. The hardcore math is also good, but I
like the immediate mystery present in the more accessible posts. I
suppose this is because the mystery drew me to math in the first place.
Alas.
