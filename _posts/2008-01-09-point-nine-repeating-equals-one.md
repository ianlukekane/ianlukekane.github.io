Let's be honest...there are certain subjects that a math-ish kind of
blog must mention at some point. One of these obligatory topics happens
to be the "0.9999999... = 1" proof. It's one of those facts that
delights the mathematically inclined. It's sort of like the joke that
Grandpa always tells when the family gets together: you know it's
coming, and you know how much pleasure he gets out of relaying the joke,
but for goodness sake, this is the 99th time you've heard the punchline.
At any rate, there is a set of about 15 math facts that people love to
talk about simply because they're all totaling mind-blowing or sound
totally nonsensical. I tend to think that the "0.9999999... = 1" proof
belongs in the latter category.

The previous digression leads me to mention the
[Things of Interest](http://qntm.org/?index) blog, and their absolutely
fantastic post on various forms of the "0.9999999... = 1" proof. You can
find that post [here](http://qntm.org/?pointnine). In case one proof
doesn't do it for you, this site offers several, each of which occurs at
a various level of mathematical rigor. There will definitely be a proof
for you here that you'll understand.
