It happens to be the case that there are two different verses in the Old
Testament which provide for an approximation of pi. In the NIV
translation both I Kings 7:23 and II Chronicles 4:2 give the following
measurements for a tank which would be enclosed in the "First" Temple:

> He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits
> from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits
> to measure around it.

Taking these measurements along with the ratio for pi given as
circumference over diameter we have a coarse approximation for pi of 3.
While not astounding in accuracy, I'm always excited to see how subtle
tidbits of mathematics invade even religious scripture. In other words,
sometimes math is beautifully inescapable.

In you're interested in learning more about these two verses I suggest
reading an article called "On the Rabbinical Exegesis of an Enhanced
Biblical Value of Pi" written by Shlomo Edward G. Belaga. An online
version of the article can be found
[here](http://www.math.ubc.ca/~israel/bpi/bpi.html). The article
surmises that the Biblical narrative lends itself to a much more
accurate approximation of pi. It's worth a look if you're intrigued by
such ideas.
