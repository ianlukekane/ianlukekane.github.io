[Dan Gilbert](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~dtg/gilbert.htm) has a few
talks posted on the [TED](http://www.ted.com) website, and the one
that's embedded here has to do with the idea of expected value, and how
this mathematical idea applies to practical life. The idea of expected
value was formalized by
[Bernoulli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bernoulli), and Dan
explains it as the product of "the odds that an action will allow us to
gain something, and the value of the gain to us". Quite simply, an
expected values is a way of quantifying whether or not a decision is a
good one. If you watch the first 5 minutes of the video below, there are
some simple examples given, but I'll throw one out as well.

Imagine that I walk up to you, and I say the following: "I'll tell you
what. Right now, I'm thinking about a color that's in a rainbow. If you
can guess what color I'm thinking about, I'll give you $14. If you guess
incorrectly, you give me $1." Do you take the bet?

Well, assuming that I'm not cheating in any way, and there are 7 colors
in a rainbow (ROYGBIV), you have a 1/7 chance of guessing correctly. And
if you win, you get $14. Given the definition from above, the expected
value of this bet is equal to (1/7) * ($14) = $2. In other words, given
this betting situation you stand to make $2. And our arrangement
dictates that if I win, you give me $1. Comparing your possible dollar
gains or losses, this is certainly a good bet. You should take it.

Where this idea gets extremely interesting is when it's applied to human
psychology and everyday decision making. Basically, we're very bad at
computing expected values in our daily lives. Obviously, I don't expect
that any of you generally has someone coming up to you offering bets of
the aforementioned type, but decisions bombard us daily.

The reason I enjoy this talk so much is that it takes a mathematical
idea and tells us why it's **PRACTICAL**. Gasp! There are a lot of
interesting examples given in this talk, and Dan is an engaging speaker.
I certainly recommend this video as a worthwhile way to spend half an
hour!
