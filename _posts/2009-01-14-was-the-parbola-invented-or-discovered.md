The latest edition of
[WNYC's Radiolab](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/) is named
"[Yellow Fluff and Other Curious Encounters](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91672-yellow-fluff-and-other-curious-encounters/)",
and brings up a few interesting questions. Namely, it asks whether
scientific knowledge is discovered, or whether it is created. With its
typical casually educational tone, this issue brings us stories from
individuals such as Steve Strogatz, who sets the theme of the hour long
program with a story about
[parabolas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola). Steve is currently a
professor in Applied Mathematics with Cornell, and in the opening of the
program he talks about being a young student, and how a simple
experiment in school led him to a eureka moment. Though Radiolab is an
audio program (which can be downloaded or listened to on their site),
they've bundled this episode with a video interpretation of Steve's
story, which can be watched below.
