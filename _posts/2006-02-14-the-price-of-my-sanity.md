For those of you who have at any point imagined that I was in some way
intelligent- you may question that appraisal after reading this post.
This past week I made one of the harder decisions I've had to make over
the past two years, and I'd like to share a bit about the experience.

If you've either read the "About Me" section of this website or know me
personally you're aware of the different jobs/environments that fill a
typical day for me. Like so many others I juggle multiple roles
simultaneously, such as husband, son, brother, employee, graduate
student, pilgrim, friend, homeowner, etc. Most of the time I manage to
travel through life holding the (apparent) ability to manage the varying
demands of these various roles. It's no surprise for me to say that
sometimes certain roles are elevated over others, whether because of the
amount of time spent in one environment, the amount of importance placed
upon a role in a given time, or whatever. It's also no surprise to say
that when you find yourself focusing exclusively on only a few life
roles that the others lose a position of prominence. In other words, you
forget about them or ignore them.

This is simple fact. I suppose this is just another way of saying that
we can't do everything. But I tell you reader, I _wish_ that I
could do everything. I wish that I could be an exemplary example of each
of my life roles. I wish I could fit everything in. I put so much
pressure on myself to do _everything_ well. Some would call this
perfectionism. I would call it not only that, but an intense desire to
live a balanced life. Historically I carry too heavy of a burden, but
hopefully the conclusion of this story will convince you of my desire
for change.

I know so many people who are doing _so_ much more than they can
handle. At least on paper. And while I do believe in a God that
sometimes calls us into apparently impossible situations, I also believe
that sometimes humans place _themselves_ in unrealistic
situations. Some of us are just doing too much. And even though I think
we each know it, we keep pushing into the future, believing that the
unwelcome intensity will one day end. Lies, I say, lies. Let's pick up
the story from here...

So last fall I took one graduate level logic class at Carnegie Mellon.
The class work took up much of the free time that I didn't have anyways.
There were many days (especially Wednesdays and Thursdays) where I
either didn't really sleep or couldn't really focus on other life roles
because the graduate student role took on an urgent quality. Notice that
I said urgent, not necessarily important. And while I do believe that
the class was important as a whole, there was so much happening outside
of class that I was missing. I wasn't able to spend nearly enough time
with certain friends. I didn't put much emphasis on spending time with
my family, especially my brother and sister whom I'd like to see more. I
had no time to read or really relax. I just kept on doing. And you know
what, I made it through. I finished the class while earning a fantastic
grade. And yet...

During the holidays, after the semester had ended, I actually had some
unbudgeted time. I had time to think again. Time to read and relax and
to see a few people. And I really started to realize that I was missing
something in my intense scheduling of life. In my constant doing I lost
sight of both being and becoming. I could no longer ignore the
ever-present voice within me whispering, "Too much."

So although I again started another graduate class at Carnegie Mellon
this spring, I won't be finishing it. I've decided to wait until the
fall to start full-time, when I will no longer be working a 40 hour work
week along with the demands of life's maintenance and the general joys
of my existence.

I dropped the class a few days after the official grace period for
taking a leave of absence ended. The financial price of my error for
Emily and I: $1200, give or take. Let me state this plainly: I am paying
money _not_ to be a student this semester. So today I can
conclusively state that I've put a price tag on the sanity of my life.
Insane, isn't it? Or maybe not. Sometimes something must break. My time
for such a break is now.

Also, on this February 14, I would like to say that I have the most
unbelievable wife there has ever been. She understands so much of what
is truly important, and has been so supportive of me in these past
several weeks where I've had so much happening in my brain.

Finally, I would like to publicly thank the philosophy department of
Carnegie Mellon for being so supportive of me in my decision. In my
experience they truly care for their students. So if anyone is checking
out CMU, here's another positive note for you to think about.
