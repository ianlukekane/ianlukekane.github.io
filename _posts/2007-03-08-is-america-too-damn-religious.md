Yesterday I listened to a fantastic podcast from the
[NPR](http://www.npr.org/) program
[Intelligence Squared U.S.](http://www.npr.org/intelligencesquared).
From the website, "Intelligence Squared U.S. brings Oxford-style
debating to America - one motion, one moderator, three panelists for the
motion and against." The specific program I listened to examines the
question, "Is America Too Damn Religious?", which is a particularly
fascinating question to me. The panelists present a scope of different
opinions on this issue, and most of the comments are well thought out.
Everyone is generally respectful, which is a trait I find important in
this type of programming. The reflections are at times theological,
political, and practical, which was an interesting mixture to listen to.
The entire program can be found
[here](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7422542).
It's possible to download a free MP3 version of the program on this
page. For those of you with iTunes, you can also find an abbreviated
version of the debate by looking for the Intelligence Squared U.S.
podcast (which is also free). The entire debate runs about 1.5 hours
(the abbreviated podcast is about 1 hour), but I think it's worth it.
For those familiar with the issues surrounding this debate I wouldn't
expect to find too much new information, but what I thought was
interesting was the particular representation of viewpoints associated
with the panelists.
