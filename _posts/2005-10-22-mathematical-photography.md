So thanks to Boing Boing I came across a beautiful page of art created
by a person named Justin Mullins
[(Mathematical Photography)](http://www.justinmullins.com/home.htm). His
art focuses exclusively on mathematical equations. I must say that I
enjoy this site immensely, both for its vision and information. What
adds to the beauty of this site is the brief poetic explanation the
artist provides for most of his pieces. I especially suggest that you
read the entries for the pieces entitled "Beauty" (Euler's Relation) ,
"Ugliness" (the Four Color Theorem), "Mystery" (Godel's Incompleteness
Theorem), and "Power" (Aleph One).

I have such a hard time when someone (usually a speaker who knows
nothing or relatively nothing about mathematics) uses an analogy that
paints the field as the dull black and white objectified reality. First,
this is not math. This is some strange twisted view of math that either
you learned in second grade or that you have been fed by our culture.
This view is pervasive and ugly. Math has so much more to do with
elegance and beauty and the greater search of making sense of
possibility.

I'd like to see two changes in the popular perception of mathematics.
First, I'd like to see a greater effort by the mathematics community to
make their material accessible to the popular masses. I believe this can
be done by pursuing some of the artistic or philosophical implications
and questions brought on by a particular technical result or problem.
There are a few people who have done this, and off the top of my head
I'd name Ian Stewart as an example. For instance, if one really looks at
Euler's Relation, and digests it like one would a Monet, I believe
there's just as much beauty to behold.

Second, I'd like to see postmodern theologians taking a more mature view
of mathematics. Rather than painting it as the personification of the
Modern era (and thus mostly an unhelpful and inorganic subject), I'd
like each and every one of them to gain a familiarity of the subject and
what it means for the twenty-first century. With this aim, I suggest
that these readers refer to Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, with some of
the philosophical questions behind it.

Check out the site. And if you have a moment try to engage one of the
pieces. Thank you Justin Mullins for taking such a simple idea and
running with it.
