I've always hated when professors have midnight due dates for
assignments. This is because there doesn't seem to be a grand
understanding of what a midnight due date actually means. For instance,
consider that I'm taking two courses, and that each of them has an
assignment due at midnight on April 1. For Professor X, midnight on
April 1 actually corresponds to 00:00:01 on April 1, i.e. the very first
moment after midnight on April 1. For Professor Z, midnight on April 1
corresponds to 23:59:59 on April 1, i.e. the very last moment before
midnight on April 2. This has bothered me so much that I've done a small
amount of research, and have come to realize that Professor X is
actually correct.

From the [official](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/info/noon.htm)
Greenwich Mean Time website, "Every day starts precisely at midnight and
A.M. starts immediately after that point in time e.g. 00:00:01 A.M."
This may seem to be obvious, but there's a remarkable amount of
confusion over the issue. Professors who understand this call for due
dates of 11:59:59 PM on a particular day. The airline industry always
rounds similarly so as to not confuse customers. So if you ever have an
assignment due at midnight, it may be in your best interest to check
with your professor about what she or he really means!

you more information about noon and midnight:
