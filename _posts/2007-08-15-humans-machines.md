[Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/) is linking today to an article that
considers the implications of the 10 year anniversary of the defeat of
chess grandmaster Gary Kasparov by IBM's Deep Blue computer. The article
([here](http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/19179/page1/)), written
by philosopher
[Daniel Dennett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett), considers
the possible differences, or lack of differences, between humans and
machines. I've linked to other pieces considered by Daniel Dennett on
this blog, and I consider him to be an articulate and fair judge over
matters of this type. It is highly worth your time to read this piece
and to think it over a bit.
