Is it possible to teach a horse how to do math? Around the year 1900 it
looked like the answer was a resounding yes. My friend Trevor suggested
that I write something up about Clever Hans, who was a horse capable of
performing mathematical feats on par with a young human teenager. Hans
could add, subtract, multiply, divide, work with fractions,
differentiate musical tones, and understand the German language. At
least, Hans could **_apparently_** do all of these things. Several other
pages have described the Clever Hans case in great detail, so I'll refer
you to them. Please check out one or more of the following links to
learn about an interesting phenomenon that has less to do with math and
more to do with psychology:
