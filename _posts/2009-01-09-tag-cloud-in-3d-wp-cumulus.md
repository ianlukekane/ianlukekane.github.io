I've come across [Roy Tanck's weblog](http://www.roytanck.com) several
different times, and in several different ways. And I must say, it's
just about the most stylish use of [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/)
I've ever seen. Amongst other skills, Roy has developed several plugins,
including [WP-Cumulus](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-cumulus/),
which is shown below. I'm thinking about making this a permanent part of
my sidebar, but at the very least I wanted to include it into this post
just to show you one of the many amazing things that's easily possible
to include within a WordPress blog. This plugin, which is visually
fantastic, took me about 5 minutes to install at max. Its also been
ported to various other blogging platforms as well. There's really good
stuff to find over at Roy's blog. Check it out.

UPDATE:
[Pe rRoy](http://www.roytanck.com/2013/01/22/you-can-now-fork-cumulus-2-0-on-github/),
this plugin is no longer maintained.
