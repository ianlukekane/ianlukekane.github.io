The next time someone asks me how I am, I am resolved to not give the
following reply:

"Busy."

I am resolved not to whine about what I've chosen for myself. I have
chosen to be married, a homeowner, a full-time employee, a part-time
graduate student, a dog owner, a member of the vestry for my church, a
member of my church, and so forth. And I have also chosen to do all of
this as a 24 year old. I have no room to bitch about being busy. If I
didn't like what I was doing, I could change it. No one held a gun to my
temple and demanded for me to enter graduate school or to buy a house. I
chose it all.

Nor will I answer: "Tired." Same issue. If I were so flipping tired, I
could change my routine.

I am not a victim, and I have lost this kind of patience for myself. So
if you ever hear me whining, please smack me.
