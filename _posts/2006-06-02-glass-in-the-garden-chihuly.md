Last wee Emily and I had the fortune to visit St. Louis, Missouri for
several days during our Midwestern tour vacation. We asked several
locals what sites they recommended seeing while there, and each person
without exception told us that we needed to see the
[Glass in the Garden](http://www.mobot.org/chihuly/) exhibition at the
[Missouri Botanical Gardens](http://www.mobot.org/default.asp). The
installation was designed by [Dale Chihuly](http://www.chihuly.com/),
who amongst other achievements holds both a Masters of Science in Glass
Blowing and a Masters of Fine Arts in Sculpture.

I must admit that art museums are often tiresome to me. Large galleries
are a sensory overload. Walking through one is an inundation of passive
information in a generally sterile environment. In other words, it's
hard for me to actually _experience_ the art. With exceptions, I am
merely an observer rather than a participant. Part of what I enjoyed so
much about the Chihuly pieces was their experiential nature. I felt that
I was _part_ of the art, and that my _being_ present actually mattered.

If I had to summarize my impression of the installation, I would use
the phrase "entwinement of the inorganic with the organic". While
walking through the nearly uncountable species of plants in the gardens
there are pieces of ornamental glass decorating the landscape. Sometimes
it actually appears as if a plant is growing glass branches. In one of
my favorite pieces there are tubes of iridescent blue glass standing
amongst an army of cool green bamboo. It almost looks as if the two
could easily coexist together in nature. Around every corner was a
merger of glass and plant. I almost felt like a child on an Easter egg
hunt, just waiting for the next treasure to appear unexpectedly. If
you'd like to see more examples of what I mean you can see Emily and my
pictures here.

While I wouldn't count Chihuly as my favorite artist (this "honor" is
held by [James Turrell](http://www.pbs.org/art21/artists/turrell/)), I
have to thank him for his creative methods. Both Turrell and Chihuly
design art which is experiential rather than merely observable. Both use
light and color with beautiful effect. Both blur the lines between
organic and inorganic. These traits, to me, embody art at its fullest.
