I really enjoyed reading
[this](http://socialmathematics.wordpress.com/2008/09/28/physicality-of-a-basic-calculator/)
post about the physicality of a calculator over at
[Social Mathematics](http://socialmathematics.wordpress.com/). The idea
of having a simple calculator available to you in your workplace or home
office setting is intriguing to me. I must admit that I do enjoy having
a basic little calculator at my disposal. I know that I can open up a
spreadsheet on my computer to take care of some maths, or that I can
simply use my brain, but there's something about using a calculator for
basic arithmetic that is appealing to me. I tend to use the calculator
as a sort of extension to my short term memory.

Of course, it's quite possible to take this idea to the extreme. Many
moons ago at a previous job, there was an individual who worked there
that was not the sharpest crayon in the box. We'll call this individual
"Slowbe", and we will assume for this story that Slowbe was a man.

Slowbe was well known for his occasional mental lapses, and I remember
hearing a story about him sitting in a meeting with several others,
going over various numbers in a spreadsheet. This was a spreadsheet that
Slowbe had created himself. As the group was looking at the numbers,
Slowbe decided that he wanted to add up several numbers in the
spreadsheet. So he left the conference room, walked around 300 meters
round trip to his desk, and returned with a pocket calculator.

Now, I'm not sure if you, the reader, are familar with Excel. But when
you have a spreadsheet open, and there are several numbers within this
spreadsheet which you'd like to add up, doing this requires about 0.4
seconds worth of work. In essence, Excel can act quite easily as a
really stinkin' powerful calculator. Everyone in the meeting (most of
whom were IT people), sort of looked at one another with "What just
happened?" kind of faces.

This, my friends, is overkill.
