In 2007 [BBC Four](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour) released a documentary
named
[Dangerous Knowledge](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/dangerous-knowledge.shtml),
which is summarized on the official page as follows:

> In this one-off documentary, David Malone looks at
> four brilliant mathematicians - Georg Cantor, Ludwig Boltzmann, Kurt
> Gödel and Alan Turing - whose genius has profoundly affected us, but
> which tragically drove them insane and eventually led to them all
> committing suicide.

Sounds uplifting, huh? Well,
[David Malone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Malone_(independent_filmmaker)),
the British filmmaker, does a really great job tracing how mathematical
ideas tie together the four individuals through history. While some of
the films claims are a bit...over the top and dramatic, overall the
content is solid and quite informative. There's a lot of information
given not only about mathematics, but about how these four individuals
dealt with various difficult aspects of their personal lives. These
videos may still be up on YouTube, but I wouldn't hold my breath for
them being there for long given the copy protection issues involved.
Having said that, I won't even attempt to embed one of the videos here.

If provided with the opportunity, you should take advantage of checking
it out the program in its entirety.
