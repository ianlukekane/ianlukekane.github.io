Yesterday I read a paper by [Tom Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/),
the chair of the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon
University, about the field of Machine Learning. This very readable
introductory paper (a 7 page PDF document) can be found
[here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/pubs/MachineLearning.pdf). As stated
by Dr. Mitchell, "Machine Learning seeks to answer the question 'How can
we build computer systems that automatically improve with experience,
and what are the fundamental laws that govern all learning processes.'"
The article surveys areas such as the current application successes of
Machine Learning, active research questions, and ethical considerations
in the discipline. If you're at all interested in interdisciplinary
computer goodness, I highly suggest checking it out.

Part of what I love about the idea of Machine Learning is that it
unavoidably collides computer science, statistics, philosophy,
psychology, neuroscience, and related learning fields. Researchers in
this area are actively exploring the overlap (which is sometimes messy,
no doubt) of various disciplines, following the trail of questions. I
plan on writing more about this later. Good stuff. Check it out.
