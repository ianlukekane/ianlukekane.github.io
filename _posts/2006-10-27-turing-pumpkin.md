How could I NOT include this picture of a pumpkin carved into the
likeness of Alan Turing? It just wouldn't be right to overlook this one!
Read more about Turing [here](http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/). In case
you don't know much about Turing, let's just say he laid a substantial
foundation for computer science.

Also,
[here's](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/10/26/mystery_explosion_in.html)
a post from [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net) describing some
mystery explosions that seem to be occurring around the world. More
Halloween goodness!
