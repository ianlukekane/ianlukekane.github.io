I hadn't heard of the
"[Look Around You](http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/lookaroundyou/)" BBC
television series before yesterday, but I was nearly on the floor
laughing by the end of the following video segment about "Maths". Read
up on the series at their
[Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_Around_You). I'm
sure the other episodes are equally as hilarious. In my opinion, there
are few things better than British humor mixed with math. Enjoy the
video!
