Wolfram, the makers of the software Mathematica, are offering a $25,000
prize to the first person who can prove whether the above 2, 3 Turing
machine is universal. From the website
([here](http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/)):

> "A universal Turing machine is powerful enough to emulate any
> standard computer.

> The question is: how simple can the rules for a universal Turing
> machine be?

> Since the 1960s it has been known that there is a universal
> [7,4 machine](http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline /page-706). In
> [_A New Kind of Science_](http://www.wolframscience.com/thebook.html),
> [Stephen Wolfram](http://www.stephenwolfram.com/) found a universal
> [2,5 machine](http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-707), and
> suggested that the particular
> [2,3 machine](http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-709) that
> is the subject of this prize might be universal.

> The prize is for determining whether or not the
> [2,3 machine](http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-709 ) is in
> fact universal."

What a great idea! I'm really curious to see how long it take for
someone to claim the prize. If you're interested in understanding more
