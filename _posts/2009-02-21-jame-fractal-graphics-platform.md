While browsing [Apple's website](http://www.apple.com/downloads/) for
various openly available math related downloads, I came across JAME, the
Java Real-Time Multi-Threaded Fractal Platform. It's awesome. The
[JAME website](http://jame.sourceforge.net/) provides the following
description:

> JAME is a [Java](http://java.sun.com/) real-time, multi-threaded
> fractal graphics platform which supports images and animations. The
> core of JAME is the graphics engine which supports layers, filters,
> effects and alpha composition. JAME creates Mandelbrot and Julia
> fractals and supports zoom, rotation and colours shifting.

The software is entirely free (under
[GPL3](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html)) and is available
for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux as long as you have met some minimum
memory requirements and have an up-to-date version of the
[Java Runtime Environment](http://java.sun.com/javase) installed. The
website for the project contains some wonderful tutorials to help get
you started, and your creations are exportable to various photo and
movie extensions. I created the following clip entirely with JAME:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EavgsHirN1Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Now, the rendering of this clip took a while on my Macbook Pro, so if
you start playing around keep in mind that the rendering of various
movie clips could take a significant amount of time, especially if you
increase the frame rate, etc. But the clip above took about 5 minutes to
create minus the rendering time. That's pretty awesome for out of the
box capability, let alone all of the customizations that are possible
once you learn more about the environment.

There's a [gallery of photos](http://jame.sourceforge.net/#gallery) on
the site to give you an idea of what's possible to create more a more
advanced user, and some awesome photos have been bundled together into a
book that can be purchased
[here](http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/388894). I've seen various
movies online that show fractal exploration, but it's a whole other
thing entirely to be in control of the exploration. If you have any
interest at all in fractals or mathematical art, I highly suggest
checking out the software.
