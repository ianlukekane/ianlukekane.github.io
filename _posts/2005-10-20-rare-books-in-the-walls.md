Emily and I bought a nearly 100 year old arts and crafts (verging on
modern) house several months ago in Edgewood (the East side of
Pittsburgh). It's a beautiful house that was designed by Frederick
Scheibler, who was a fairly well-known Pittsburgh architect around the
turn into the 20th century. He has many spaces in Pittsburgh, and
they're all gorgeous. If you've been around the area you've probably
seen some. For instance, one of his buildings is the Shadyside Variety
Store building in Shadyside, which has gorgeous apartments on the higher
floors.

Somewhere between the time that our house was built and the present
there have been some substantial changes to the space, and not all of
them have been for the better. For instance, several built-in bookcases
and window seats have been removed and sold off. It sucks, but I suppose
that's the economics of a 100 year old home.

One of the changes to the space was that a coat closet was created on
the lefthand side of the entryway. It is ugly. So ugly, in fact, that Em
and I decided that it needed to go. So on Monday night I decided that I
was going to begin to rip this sucker down. So I did. I started at the
bottom and worked toward the ceiling, removing wood and nails and
spraying dust around into the air.

There was a piece os wood paneling covering the space between the top of
the closet and the ceiling, which a started to knock out with a hammer.
But after several swipes I immediately noticed that there was something
behind the covering. What I found was books. OLD books. There were about
30 of them and many of them were over 100 years old. Several of them
still have the inscriptions inside the covers, indicating where they
came from whose they were. Cool. Very cool.

Neither Em or I has any idea of how or why they got there. It's
extremely random. It's helping us to uncover a bit more history about
this house, and we might even be able to donate or sell some of them. So
here's a reason to live in an old house: it may be full of wonderful and
inexplicable old stuff!
