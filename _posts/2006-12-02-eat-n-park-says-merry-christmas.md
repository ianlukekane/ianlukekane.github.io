If you grew up in Pittsburgh you always knew that it was officially the
holiday season when you saw this commercial. Seriously, I know it's
dumb, but this 30 second TV spot always makes me feel a bit sentimental.
I thought I would post it here since I know quite a few Pittsburgh folks
who read this site. Enjoy!
