Happy [Pi Day](http://www.piday.org/), everyone. It seems that the U.S.
Congress has actually declared it this year. That's funny. It's also
funny to surf around to various websites to see how much merchandise is
available to commemorate this day. I guess everybody needs a holiday,
huh? Well, if you celebrate Pi Day in any way, I suggest not getting
caught up in all the glitz, but instead think back on the various ways
that Pi has influenced your life; e.g. your trig class when you were 15.
Check out the first link in this post to see the official Pi Day
website, including some fun ideas of how to celebrate the day!

And if you've never seen the following visual representation of Pi,
enjoy!
