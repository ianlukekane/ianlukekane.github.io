<img align="left" hspace=7px src="/assets/hotdogma.jpeg"> I thought I
should let everyone know that my friends over at
[Hot Dogma](http://franktuary.com/), which happens to be the best hot
dog shop in the city of Pittsburgh, have recently had a syndicated news
story come across from the AP. You can read that article
[here](http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/today/s_476430.html).
Also, there's another local news article
[here](http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06297/732392-53.stm) and some
local news video of the story
[here](http://www.wpxi.com/video/10150137/detail.html) (link may not be
Mac friendly). I don't understand the situation fully, but Hot Dogma is
being legally forced to relinquish its name due to a certain type of
copyright infringement with another restaurant located in Miami, FL. The
so-called Dogma Grill believes that it's necessary to squash the name of
a business located hundreds and hundreds of miles away. Okay. Good for
you. At any rate, Hot Dogma won't be closing its doors, but will be born
again under a different name. If you're curious about what that new name
may be, click on the link above!
