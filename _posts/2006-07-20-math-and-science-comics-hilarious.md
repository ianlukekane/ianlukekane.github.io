Thanks to [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net) I found Randall
Munroe's [website](http://xkcd.com/) this morning, which describes
itself as "a webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language". Some of
the comics are tremendously funny, especially if you're a dork, which I
am. Here's one of my favorites:

![xkcd Moral Relativity](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/moral_relativity.jpg)

Here are a few of my other favorites from the site (warning: there's a
bit of swearing in some of these if you're offended by that kind of
thing):

[Computational Linguistics](http://xkcd.com/c114.html)  
[Centrifugal Force](http://xkcd.com/c123.html)  
[dPain Over dt](http://xkcd.com/c128.html)  
[Science](http://xkcd.com/c54.html)  
[Su Doku](http://xkcd.com/c74.html)  
[Fourier](http://xkcd.com/c26.html)

Happy laughing everyone!
