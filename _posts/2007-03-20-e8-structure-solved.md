There was an announcement yesterday that a collaboration of
mathematicians from the United States and Europe have mapped the
structure of E8, which is a 248-dimensional
[Lie group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group). It's actually even
more rich than that, but I think the concept of a Lie group is intense
enough for one post. What interests me most about this particular
problem is that there was some SERIOUS computer horsepower that went
into the solution. As the Yahoo! news story indicates, "While the human
genome, which contains all the genetic information of a cell, is less
than a gigabyte in size, the result of the E8 calculation, which
contains all the information about E8, is 60 gigabytes in size." Yikes.
Amongst other practical applications this result will provide some good
information for physicists who study string theory. The reason for this
is that structure of E8 is both symmetrical and extremely complex.
Please check out the American Institute of Mathematics page on the E8
project [here](http://aimath.org/E8/) for more information. There's a
lot of great information on their site. So what does the structure of E8
look like? Here's the picture:
