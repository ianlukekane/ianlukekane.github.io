My post from a few days ago that mentioned the public domain status of
Bertrand Russell's "The Problems of Philosophy" reminded me to check
whether [LibriVox](http://librivox.org) had any audio recordings of
Russell's works that are now in the public domain. If you've never heard
of LibriVox, the site explains that:

> LibriVox volunteers record chapters of books in the public domain and
> release the audio files back onto the net. Our goal is to make all
> public domain books available as free audio books.

The site has some amazing content, including a complete audio copy of
"The Problems of Philosophy" (as well as a few other Russell titles). So
for those of you who prefer to listen to audio books, there are some
great philosophy, logic, and mathematics related books are available.
Here are links for a few:

  * [The Problems of Philosophy, by Bertrand Russell](http://librivox.org/the-problems-of-philosophy-by-bertrand-russell/)
  * [Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions, by Edwin Abbott Abbott](http://librivox.org/flatland-a-romance-of-many-dimensions-by-edwin-abbott-abbott/)
