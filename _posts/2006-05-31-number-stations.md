According to its
[Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_stations), a
numbers station is "a shortwave radio station of uncertain origins."
According to both direct and indirect evidence a numbers station is a
radio station used by a government to communicate secretive information
to its spies. A stereotypical numbers station broadcast is basically
comprised of a seemingly nonsensical sequence of numbers or letters read
by a human voice. The idea is that the spy listens to the broadcast and
then is able to decipher the sequence using a previously received
decoder. In theory, if the spy has kept the decoder secretive, the code
is almost literally unbreakable. In other words, this is a fairly secure
way to pass sensitive information.

You can listen to a good example of a numbers station broadcast
[here](http://www.archive.org/details/ird059). I suggest not listening
to this alone at night, as it sounds a bit creepy. This recording is one
of many included in the Conet Project, which according to
[Archive.org](http://www.archive.org/details/ird059) is "the first
comprehensive collection of Numbers Stations recordings released to the
public".

Given the news of various NSA activities in America over the last
several months I thought it would be interesting to write something
about "spy" activity. There's a lot of great in-depth information
(including many audio examples of numbers station broadcasts) located in
both the Wikipedia article and on Archive.org (both previously linked),
so I suggest checking these out if you're interested at all. Who knows,
the next time you turn on a shortwave radio maybe all you'll hear is
numbers.
