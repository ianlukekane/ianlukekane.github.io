While Emily and I are in the process of totally remaking our downstairs
space we've moved all of our belongings to other parts of the house.
This includes our television, which has made its way upstairs to our
"guest room", which is now serving as our dorm living headquarters. It's
basically the only living space in the entire house right now, so it's
grand central station for the time we're spending in the house and not
sanding, stripping paint, or whatever. Since the TV is upstairs we
currently don't have it hooked up to cable. On Saturday evening, while
Em was out with some old friends, I was bored and tried to check out
what could be found on the television. Amidst the static I found three
channels which offered actual content. The content was distressing.
Rather, the content was a reminder of some of the worst parts of the
American condition. Here's what I found on the stations:

1. A generic home shopping network program, i.e. the worst possible
   caricature of American consumerism, where the watcher is asked to
   consume mostly worthless cultural artifacts. I believe when I was
   flipping through that the fare of the moment was some sort of
   terribly ugly fake jewelry.

2. An infomercial, sponsored by GM, for their OnStar system, i.e. the
   most blatant and strange type of marketing message that exists. While
   the show tried to pawn itself off as a source of safety information
   in reality it was just a long commercial for GM vehicles.

3. Christian religious programming of the worst kind. I made myself
   watch it for about a quarter hour. I was sickened. I'm so sorry to
   all of you who believe that this is what Christianity either is, or
   what it has been reduced to. The message of the show was that (for
   the price of a lofty sum of money) God would give you success,
   whether it be in occupation, finances, or whatever. Sigh...

Needless to say I turned off the television quite soon after turning it
on. But I still can't quite shake the message that the three programs
sent to me. It's disturbing. But what shall I say, is this not America?
At least in some of its worst forms surely it is.
