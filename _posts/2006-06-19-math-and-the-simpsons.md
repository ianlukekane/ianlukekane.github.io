Check out
[this article](http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20060610/bob8.asp)
over at [Science News Online](http://www.sciencenews.org/) that explores
some of the wonderful mathematics references that have found their place
in episodes of [The Simpsons](http://www.thesimpsons.com/index.html).
For instance, in one episode "Kwik-E-Mart proprietor Apu brags that he
can recite pi to 40,000 decimal places. "The last digit is 1," he
announces. To get that detail right, the _Simpsons_ writing team faxed a
query to NASA, where mathematician David Bailey obliged with the digit
in question."

It's good to know that great comedy doesn't always have to be brainless.
