[Matt Gaffney](http://crosswordcontest.blogspot.com/), a 15 year
veteran of professional crossword puzzle writing, wrote an article in
late November for
[Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/gaming/2009/11/it_themes_somehow_familiar.html)
about the likeliness of two crossword puzzle creators replicating the
same, or approximately the same, puzzle. Crosswords exhibit 180-degree
rotational symmetry, meaning that "if you turn the grid upside down, the
pattern of black squares will look the same as it does right-side up."
Couple that with a specifically themed puzzle (e.g. Halloween and Edgar
Allen Poe), a certain number of long word entries, and general crossword
rules (e.g. no two letter words are allowed), the probability may be
higher than you think.

In a nutshell, Gaffney found that he had inadvertently used many
similar aspects of a puzzle that had been released earlier in the year,
and thus traces several reasons why this may have been the case. One
interesting twist to the story is what happens when Gaffney asks a third
crossword creator to write a similarly themed puzzle. Do you think that
this third puzzle turned out to have similar entries to the first two?
