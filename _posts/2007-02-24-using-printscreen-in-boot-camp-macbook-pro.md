I just spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to take screen
shots in Windows XP on my MacBook Pro (using Boot Camp). I thought I
would write up the _simplest_ answer of how to do this, in the sense
that you don't have to install anything or remap your keyboard. Here's
all you have to do:

Under the Start menu, select **All Programs**, then **Accessories**,
then **Accessibility**, and then **On-Screen Keyboard**. When you do
this the Windows XP on-screen keyboard will appear on your screen. This
on-screen utility includes the PrintScreen button (labelled **psc** in
the same position as where the **F13** key should be located. That's it.

If you want to take a screen shot of only the active window (using the
**Alt+psc** command), make sure that the on-screen keyboard isn't in the
area of the active window, otherwise it will be included in the screen
shot.

Anyway, I searched around for far too long to find that little piece of
information, so hopefully someone in the same predicament will easily be
able to find this post (and the answer)! Since the Apple external
keyboards actually include the **F13** key (while the MacBook and
MacBook Pro built-in keyboards do not), you can use PrintScreen slightly
easier with the plugged-in keyboard.

**UPDATE**: As pointed out by Stuart in the comments below, if you're
using Boot Camp v. 1.3, **Fn + F11** now maps to print screen. You can
print only the active window with **Option + Fn + F11**. Thanks for the
tip!
