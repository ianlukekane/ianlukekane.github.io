I started thinking about the RSA Factoring challenge the other day when
I received my RSA SecureID fob to log into the UPMC network offsite.
According to the RSA website, "The RSA Factoring challenge is an effort,
sponsored by RSA Laboratories, to learn about the actual difficulty of
factoring large numbers of the type used in RSA keys. A set of eight
challenge numbers, ranging in size from 576 bits to 2048 bits is posted
[here](http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2093). Each number
is the product of two large primes, similar to the modulus of an RSA key
pair." So if you feel like trying to make yourself an easy $200,000, try
to factor the following number as the product of two primes:

If you're interested in learning about the history of RSA, which is an
algorithm for public key encryption that helps to make internet security
tick, you should read [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA)Wikipedia
article or check out the RSA Laboratories
[website](http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/).
