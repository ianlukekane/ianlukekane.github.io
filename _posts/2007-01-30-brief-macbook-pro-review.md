<img align="left" hspace=7px src="/assets/ilk_20070130.jpg"> I am the
proud owner of a 15" Macbook Pro. It has 2GB of RAM. My iBook only had
256MB of RAM. Think about it. I must say that I'm extremely pleased so
far with the purchase. Even Dreamweaver and MS Office are running really
well under Rosetta. I really can't complain at all about the
performance. I've also installed Boot Camp, so I'm also running Windows
XP. I've decided not to worry about either Vista or Office 2007 until
the summer. By that point a lot of people and businesses will have moved
over. So far I have to say that Windows is running quite well. Once I do
some heavier duty stuff I'll report back on what I've found. I thought
about using Parallels but decided against it for the time being. I'll
wait until Leopard to see if Apple will enable users to switch between
operating systems without having to reboot. If that's the case I have no
reason to buy Parallels (other than to easily play with Linux).
Otherwise I'll have to reconsider. As far as my other software needs are
concerned, TeXShop was already available as a universal binary, and TeX
installed really easily on the machine. Time will tell. If anyone has
any particular questions about what I think about the computer let me
know. The self-portrait in this post was taken with the built-in iSight
camera.
