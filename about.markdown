Welcome to the personal site of Ian Luke Kane. You'll find my resume and
a way to contact me below. I also have some incredibly old blog posts
here that I'm leaving up more for posterity than anything since they're
all outdated and malformed. I like data. I like math. I like my bicycle.
If you're wondering what I'm thinking about these days there's a good
chance you can glean that from
